# My collections 

WORK IN PROGRESS
Should allow to manage a library of games/books/anything with very simple maintenance.
I was using markdown in the beginning, but didn't like that solution, so I switched to a JSON database to make it more simple.
The github pages are taking the information directly from the JSON file so I don't need to modify each page every time.
